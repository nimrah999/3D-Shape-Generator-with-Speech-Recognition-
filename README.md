 **Project Preview**  

A web-based interactive 3D model generator using **Three.js** and **Google Speech Recognition API**. Speak shape names like "sphere," "cylinder," "cube," or "tetrahedron," and watch them render in real-time.  

**Features:**  
- Real-time speech-to-shape rendering  
- Supports multiple 3D primitives (sphere, cylinder, cube, tetrahedron)  
- Built using **Three.js** for 3D visualization and **Google Speech Recognition API** for voice input  

 **Access on Demand:** Watch the demo video (MP4) included in this repository.  

**Note**
